# Wishlist App

A modern wishlist application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It uses json-server as a fake REST API for CRUD operations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

You need to run two commands in separate terminals:

**Terminal 1 - Start the JSON Server:**
```bash
npm run server
```

This will start the fake REST API on `http://localhost:3001`

**Terminal 2 - Start the React App:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port)
